# üêä Tomistoma-Distributions-Reproducible-Codeüêä #
This is all the code for my master‚Äôs thesis, **Uncovering the geographic distribution of *Tomistoma schlegelii* and the role of anthropogenic pressures to inform their current status and future risk**

This Github repository was completed as part of my master‚Äôs course (Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Research) at Imperial College London.

# Raw data #

**False gharial presence records**
All *Tomistoma schlegelii* presence records sourced from; both published and unpublished datasets, 211 from Steubing et al., (2006), 113 from Sideleau (2023), 36 from Dr Agata Staniewicz and 23 from The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (2023), with additional data from; museum specimen records, sightings, published journal articles and archival field expedition journals.

**All wrangled data** for analysis and plotting has been provided on Google Drive:

All the R code utilized for mapping, wrangling and analysis is given in this repository. Underneath I provide a short explanation of every script.

**Mapping.Rmd-** This script plots *Tomistoma schlegelii* presence records sourced from; both published and unpublished datasets, museum specimen records, sightings, published journal articles and archival field expedition journals.

**Wrangling Presence Records.Rmd-** This script wrangles *Tomistoma schlegelii* presence records sourced from; both published and unpublished datasets, museum specimen records, sightings, published journal articles and archival field expedition journals.
